## Decisions

ADRs that constrain later features live in `docs/ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md` and `docs/architecture-refactoring-roadmap.md` §10. This table does not duplicate them.

| AD-001 | Architecture sequencing and DI live guidance is `docs/architecture-refactoring-roadmap.md` (ADR-2 explicit composition), not abstract-class tsyringe tokens | T0.1 freeze; agents were still copying MOD-1 abstract tokens | active | 2026-09-19 |
| AD-002 | Module DAG is enforced with `dependency-cruiser` starting at `warn`, not `eslint-plugin-boundaries`                                                         | ADR-3; ESLint is being removed (ADR-1)                       | active | 2026-09-19 |
